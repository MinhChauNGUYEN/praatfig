# praatfig
Simple example scripts to learn to produce great figures with Praat 

Intended for training at LPP (Laboratoire de Phon√©tique et Phonologie), March 2019.

## Requirements
- Obviously, **Praat** is required. Find the latest version at http://www.praat.org.
- **Short audio segment(s)**: For practice, you can use the sound of this demo or you can extract an segment from your own data. The electroglottalgraphic signal (EGG) can be included. 
- **Notepad++** for final cleaning on EPS graphics file. 
- [**Eps viewer**](https://epsviewer.org/) for considering output figure.

## Usage
1. Prepare input files and put them in the same folder with the script praatfig. The inputs files are depend on what you want to display in the figure. In this demo we need audio file with EGG signal is included (extension `.wav`), spectrogram (extension `.Spectrogram`).  
2. Update input information in available script
3. 

## Behind the script 
1. You can understand and write the scripts yourself.
The script is actually a record of all the actions that you can do on `Praat Objects` and `Praat Picture`. In other words, without a script you are still be able to make a figure by using functions on those two windows of Praat. 
So, *why we need script?* The answer is that it's much easier and faster to produce many figures with the same scales (mass production). 

2. Order of the commands are important
- Always beginning with clear command `Erase all`
