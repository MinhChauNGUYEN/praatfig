This script has served the production of two Figures in my ICPhS-2019 paper. 

It is majorly based on the **Praatfig#1**, but has been added to the values of f0 and Oq which are not available in Praat. 
They were calculated by [Peakdet](https://github.com/alexis-michaud/egg/tree/master/peakdet_inter) in Matlab 
using electroglottography signal which is also demonstrated on the Figure (under audio signal). 
The obtained values was drawn in Praat using the command `Paint circle`. Each circle corresponds to one value. 

**Praatfig#2** assumes that the user has already known how the [**Praatfig#1**](https://github.com/MinhChauNGUYEN/praatfig/tree/master/Script1_Beginner) works.
